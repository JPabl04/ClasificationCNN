Clasificating Hand-Written Characters using Convolutional Neuronal Networks.

Convolutional Neuronal Networks (CNN) are commonly used when we are interested in the clasification of images. The following project serves as a basic classificator of Hand-Written characters which goes from 0 to 9 and from A to Z (including lowercase and capital letters). I implemented three types of Networks: a dense one, other with DropOut (DO) and the last one without DO. 

Below is presented a comparation of the three different models and its respectively accuracy values

One can easily see that the CNN with DO (CNN&DO) has a better performance than the CNN without DO (CNN)
